# Project Manager

This Prototype of an Open Source Project, I am planned to create in future.
<br>
The aim is to ease the Development of any Tech Project, Individually or in 
Team (tasks, bugs, …, trainings (for new entrants), ….).
<br><br>
With modern UI/UX Design.
<br><br>
So this Project is more to test some implementations and give some short overview.
<br>
We can think it is a Small Version of the Open Source Project.
